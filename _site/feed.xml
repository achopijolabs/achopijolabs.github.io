&lt;p&gt;This new year we have no resolutions because resolutions are almost always discarted. We have the objective of
building our first project with a business plan, our first idea that can be commercialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next project (School Core) is in our heads and this year is going to be developed and turned into reality. That's the objective for AchoPijo Labs for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web application for our clients, a mobile app for their customers and all the backend (api rest, databases, servers...) is going to be build. The technologies... probably microsoft stack because our background is mostly .NET but we are curious about MEAN stack or some solution with both (.NET backend and angular frontend). The security of using what you already know or betting for Angular or even React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Digital Architects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the opportunity of learning new technologies and bring to life our ideas. We are digital architects, we don't need bricks nor concrete, we just need a laptop and imagination, passion and motivation for our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer, there are no barriers, just your imagination .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>juanlubarreda</name></author><summary type="html">No resolutions, just objectives</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">School Core</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/school-core" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="School Core" /><published>2016-07-25T14:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-07-25T14:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/school-core</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/school-core">&lt;p&gt;School core aims to be the communication platform between schools and parents, providing all the information from children's classroom that parents need to know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>juanlubarreda</name></author><summary type="html">School core aims to be the communication platform between schools and parents, providing all the information from children's classroom that parents need to know.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bici apps</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/bici-apps" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bici apps" /><published>2016-07-24T14:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-07-24T14:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/bici-apps</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/bici-apps">&lt;p&gt;This project is a first approach for using Ionic 2 and Angular 2 technologies.

This way you can evaluate the response of the Spanish society for any type of event that may involve the expression of national sentiment as a world championship , an election or any specified date.

To accomplish this task we perform an analysis in real-time on Twitter (analyzing each tweet published) seeking related to the manifestation of a spanish positive feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>juanlubarreda</name></author><summary type="html">This is a project that comes with the need to ‘measure’ somehow the Spanish sentiment expressed through social networks .
