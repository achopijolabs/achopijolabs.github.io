<p>This project is a first approach for using Ionic 2 and Angular 2 technologies. It consumes a location api bike stations labici.net showing the bikes available and free parking spaces.

Iâ€™ve published applications for the following Spanish cities: Murcia, Getafe , Ponferrada, Gandia , Altea, Benidorm and Majadahonda.</p>
