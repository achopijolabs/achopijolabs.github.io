<p>This is a project that comes with the need to ‘measure’ somehow the Spanish sentiment expressed through social networks . This way you can evaluate the response of the Spanish society for any type of event that may involve the expression of national sentiment as a world championship , an election or any specified date.

To accomplish this task we perform an analysis in real-time on Twitter (analyzing each tweet published) seeking related to the manifestation of a spanish positive feeling.</p>
